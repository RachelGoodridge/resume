I created an interactive website application that allows users to select

create customizable dataframe queries, and observe visualizations of the
changes in COVID cases and vaccines over time. It is meant to be
informative to the general public, and ideally can be used to identify

programs. I developed this app with Streamlit and deployed it using
GitHub. Draw conclusions and create your own interpretations by visiting

<h3>Developing a Recommendation System for Wine Enthusiasts</h3>
<p>The purpose of this model is to create a wine recommendation system
for wine enthusiasts of all experience levels that allows users to
explore new options and effortlessly make decisions about their next
wine purchase. The <a
href="https://www.kaggle.com/mysarahmadbhat/wine-tasting">dataset</a>
includes 49,546 unique wine tastings and descriptions written by
sommeliers. Using text preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and
topic modeling, I created a content-based filtering system that can be
used to find the closest match to any given wine in the dataset. The
search can also be narrowed, based on user input, such that the
algorithm only returns wines with the specific features requested by the
consumer.</p>

<h3>Predicting Potentially Hazardous Asteroids</h3>
<p>Near-Earth Objects (NEOs), such as asteroids, occasionally have the
potential to collide with Earth and cause enormous damage. NASA has been
documenting these NEOs as well as many other types of space-going debris
and developing diversion tactics given the event of an impact threat.
From <a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/sbdb_query.html">NASA’s
Small-Body Database</a>, information about asteroids was used to train a
machine learning classification model and predict which asteroids are
potentially hazardous. Following oversampling to address class imbalance
and optimization of many parameters, the best model based on F1
validation scores was XGBoost Classifier. The score on the holdout data
was 0.784 and the most important features were absolute magnitude,
closest distance to the sun, and orbit uncertainty.</p>

<h3>Comparing Microsoft vs. Nintendo vs. Sony</h3>
<p>To help Microsoft compete against Nintendo and Sony in the gaming
world, several data analysis algorithms and data science techniques can

depending on the preference for diversification of game availability or
improvement of the current gaming niche. Further work such as clustering
games into categories, making predictions from time series analysis, and
using natural language processing to hunt for truths should be conducted
as well.</p>

also be made between distributors and genres using dummy variables.
Relative to Focus Features, Universal Pictures and Walt Disney Pictures
perform better, while Open Road Films performs worse. Relative to

<h3>Background Information</h3>
<p><em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> is a millimeter long roundworm (or
nematode) found worldwide in soil and rotting plant matter. It commonly
serves as an ideal model organism for various types of genetic and
evolutionary experimental studies due to its fast life cycle, ease of
maintenance, and simple neurological structure. Click <a

<h3><em>C. elegans</em> Life History Model</h3>
<p>I recently completed a Master of Science in Biology
(Evolution/Behavior/Ecology Department), conducting research in a lab
led by Dr. Scott Rifkin. I studied the evolution of a particular phase
of the worm life cycle called dauer. This stage of development is an
intermediate larval stage during which the worm can “choose” to go into
a stasis-like state given difficult environmental conditions
(e.g. overcrowding or lack of food) [Hu 2007]. As part of my research, I
developed a population ecology/evolution model in Python to simulate the
development of a group of individuals and/or their offspring, their
interactions with each other, and their responses to specific
environmental conditions. The model takes many realistic factors into
account (e.g. genetics and the role of “randomness” in decision-making)
[Avery 2014] when determining if a particular worm will go into the
dauer phase of development. I also conducted studies in the laboratory
to improve particular aspects of the model and, in the future, more
experiments can be performed to test the accuracy of its
predictions.</p>

of the model can be found <a

<h3>Abstract of the Thesis</h3>
<p>Nematodes such as <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em>, <em>C.
briggsae</em>, <em>C. remanei</em>, and <em>C. nigoni</em> are model
organisms that primarily reside in rotting fruit and plant matter,
feeding on the bacteria that inhabit these degrading vegetation [Frézal
&amp; Félix 2015]. When conditions are poor, worms must decide whether
to go into a larval stage called dauer [Avery 2014]. Entering dauer
would allow the worms to survive for months; however, the risk of dying
in dauer is high and this results in a tradeoff. I created an extensive
model in Python to simulate the population dynamics and decision-making
strategies of worms and their responses to various environmental
conditions. This model includes genes related to both dauer and travel
direction decision making strategies. Experiments showed significant
evolution of both genes when there is stronger selection against worms
in dauer, both genes when there is higher frequency of food
availability, the dauer gene only when the dauer genotype to phenotype
mapping is altered, and neither gene when seasonality in terms of
environmental productivity is introduced. Stronger selection against
worms in dauer led them to evolve a lower likelihood of dauer and a
preference for traveling away from neighbors. A higher frequency of food
availability also led them to evolve a lower likelihood of dauer but a
preference for traveling towards food. A higher genotype to phenotype
mapping value led them to evolve a lower likelihood of dauer as well.
However, there may be some underlying patterns present in many of these
experiments that require further study.</p>

<div id="larval-dietary-restriction-experiment" class="section level3">
<h3>Larval Dietary Restriction Experiment</h3>
<p>One aspect of my model I tested in lab is whether the quantity of
food available to a worm determines its transition to the next stage of
development or if it is simply a matter of time passing. Studies show
that life span is food-dependent, specifically adult worms have an
increased life span if fed a restricted diet [e.g. Klass 1977, Lee et
al. 2006]. However, it is unknown whether larval stages experience the
same effect. To test this, I designed an experiment in lab with four
treatment groups of L1 (first larval stage) worms, each fed a different
concentration of <em>E. coli</em> (6 mg/mL, 4.8 mg/mL, 3.6 mg/mL, or 2.4
mg/mL). If the effect is the same on larvae as it is on adults, the
expected outcome would be statiscially different lengths of time spent
in L1 before molting to L2/L2d (second larval stage). To determine when
the worms are molting, I used a specific strain of <em>C. elegans</em>
with a gfp (green fluorescent protein) marker on the molting gene that
makes the worms glow under an epifluorescent microscope when they’re
molting. The glow will last for about three hours, peaking in intensity
when they molt [Monsalve et al. 2011]. One complication, however, is
that if the worms are not completely synchronized in age (i.e. they
don’t all start from time zero in their life stage), and depending on
how far apart in age they are, the results may be confounded by this
variation. I created a simulation to test whether unsynchronized worms
can produce statistically significant results and found that they can,
but not as well as worms that are synchronized in age. After performing
this test in silico, I designed and conducted this experiment in the lab
and I found that larval dietary restriction does lengthen the amount of
time spent in that stage. This means that the amount of time it takes a
worm to molt from one larval stage to the next is food-dependent and
aligns with the assumption made in the model.</p>
<p>A sample of the code and results of the simulation can be found <a
